        What looked like a small patch of purple grass, above five feet square, was moving across
        the sand in their direction. When it came near enough he perceived that it was not grass;
        there were no blades, but only purple roots. The roots were revolving, for each small plant
        in the whole patch, like the spokes of a rimless wheel.
